## About The Project

The project is an innovative and user-friendly Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page designed to provide a seamless and informative experience for users seeking answers to common queries. With a modern interface, users can easily navigate through a curated list of frequently asked questions, expanding and collapsing answers with a simple click. Additionally, the application features a 'Load More' functionality, allowing users to access a broader range of questions. Developed with the latest web technologies, the FAQ page prioritizes functionality and aesthetics to create an efficient and visually appealing platform for addressing user inquiries.
